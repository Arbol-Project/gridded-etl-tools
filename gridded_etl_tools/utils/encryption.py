"""Allow Zarrs to be saved using XChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption.

In order to use encryption with this library, one need only generate an encryption key,
and then pass the generated key into the constructor of a
:class:`.dataset_manager.DatasetManager` subclass. The user only needs to keep track of
their encryption key. Everything else is managed from there.

Underneath the hood, encryption keys at run time are hashed using a cryptographically
secure hashing algorithm (SHA3-256) and then registered. Because the
:class:`EncryptionFilter` gets serialized in place with the Zarr, its configuration is
saved as part of the Zarr. The hash of its encryption key is stored in the Zarr, and
then turned into the actual key by looking it up by hash in the registry. In this way,
we can know at run time which key was used to encrypt the Zarr, as long as it is present
in he current run time registry, but attackers who have access to the Zarr but not the
encryption key cannot decrypt the Zarr.
